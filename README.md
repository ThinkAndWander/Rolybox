## Rolybox Source
This is the source code. The website is [here](https://thinkandwander.github.io/Rolybox).

Rolybox is a fork of Ultrabox. This is a staging area for modifications I make, to be incorporated in other mods of beepbox (lovingly called "beepmods") later.

### Unique changes on this fork as of 7/21
- Settings organized into tabs (instrument tab, empty tab for note operations later)
- New note operations: merge, bridge, horizontal/vertical stretch, horizontal/vertical mirror, step, segmentize, flatten, spread notes, stutter notes
- Note operations are under Edit menu, but they're not done yet. They are set to hardcoded values
- Move notes sideways now works per-channel, for each channel selected. If no channels are selected, it affects the *current* one instead of all channels
